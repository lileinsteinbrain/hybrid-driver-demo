## What this is
A system that translates racing telemetry data into sound, using rhythm and modulation to expose temporal driving patterns.

## Input
- Telemetry data such as throttle, brake, steering, and speed
- Time-series data recorded across laps or sessions

## Processing
- Telemetry streams are normalized and smoothed over time
- Driving inputs are mapped to sound parameters such as rhythm, intensity, and modulation
- Temporal patterns emerge from continuous data rather than discrete events

## Output
- Synthesized sound generated from driving telemetry
- Audible patterns reflecting changes in driving behavior over time

## What currently works
- Telemetry data can be consistently mapped to sound output.
- Different driving styles produce clearly different rhythmic structures.
- Temporal variations become perceptible through sound.

## What’s unfinished
- Stabilization of mappings across different tracks or sessions.
- Further exploration of how sound patterns relate to driving behavior.

## Why it matters
Synthracer offers an alternative way to read performance data, making temporal structure perceptible without relying on visual dashboards.
